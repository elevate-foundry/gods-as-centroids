# Braille Lattice Generalizability — Non-Theological Domains

## Claim

> The braille lattice is not theology-specific. The same discrete bottleneck
> architecture preserves semantic structure across fundamentally different domains,
> suggesting it functions as a **general-purpose semantic compression operator**.

## Interpretation

If all three domains show high centroid preservation (>0.99 cosine),
high classification accuracy (>80%), and high similarity rank correlation
(ρ > 0.95), then the braille lattice is a **domain-agnostic** semantic
compression operator. The theological application is one instance of a
general principle: structured meaning survives discrete compression
regardless of the semantic domain.

This is the foundation of the AGI bridge claim: if meaning is compressible
to discrete lattice points across arbitrary domains, then a shared lattice
could serve as a universal semantic substrate for heterogeneous AI systems
that need to maintain coherent meaning across modalities and scales.
